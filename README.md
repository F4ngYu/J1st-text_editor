# J1st-text_editor
A lightweight, minimal, and beginner-friendly text editor built from scratch. ✍️ 

The idea is to build a text editor for the browser(not an online compiler, JUST A TEXT EDITOR!!).
I have discussed more about the future of this project later in this file refer to the `Future of this Project` section.

# Future of this project:
  This project is still lacking option to open files and doesn't have any file tree like `neo-tree` in nvim. At its present state it can change the name of file edit the contents and save the file. It is also lacking the looks.

# Explanation:
  In future, any changes made or any extra dependency to be installed is added then it should be explained breifly in the README.md. Also try to keep the file structure and the files organised and clean.
